### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

By day, I am a C++ developer creating experiences in Unreal Engine for the games industry. By night, I am a modder, game developer, and open source enthusiast. These are some of the projects I'm proud of, in no particular order:

## Minecraft Modding
 - [wiki.bedrock.dev](https://wiki.bedrock.dev/) is a community-sourced documentation wiki for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Add-ons (DAU ~2k)
 - [Regolith](https://bedrock-oss.github.io/regolith/) is an add-on compiler written in Golang
 - [Echo:NPC](https://sirlich.github.io/echo-npc-documentation/) is a premium package for reactive entities, which is now open source.
 - [... and more!](https://sirlich.github.io/) 

## Sapiens Modding
 - [wiki.sapiens.dev](https://wiki.sapiens.dev/) is a community sourced documentation wiki for creating Sapiens mods
 - [Hammerstone](https://github.com/Sapiens-OSS/hammerstone-framework) is a modding framework for Sapiens, written in Lua
 - My collection of mods is vast, including [Creative Mode](https://github.com/SirLich/sapiens-creative-mode), [Vanilla Tweaks](https://github.com/SirLich/sapiens-vanilla-tweaks), [Bone Crafting](https://github.com/SirLich/sapiens-bone-crafting), and [Furniture](https://github.com/SirLich/sapiens-furniture) (Total downloads ~20k)

## Godot
 - [My itch.io](https://itch.io/c/3467138/jam-games) page has some jam-games I've created (GMTK, Global Game Jam, Ludum Dare)
 - [My small but growing youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhoVDeLMcks&t=78s) has a few tutorials, and hopefully soon some showcases
 - Although unfinished, I've been learning about godot Editor Tooling via the creation of a [digital asset manager](https://github.com/SirLich/asset-explorer)
